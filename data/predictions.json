The Lions boast a robust rushing attack, averaging 138.1 yards per game, a significant edge over Dallas's 121.8 YPG. On a short week, the ability to control the clock and dictate tempo through a strong run game is paramount, and Detroit is well-positioned to exploit this at home. We are confidently backing the Lions to leverage their physical advantage and cover the spread.",

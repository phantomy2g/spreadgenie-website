    "analysis": "The market is flashing a nuclear trap signal on this matchup. With an overwhelming 88% of the public money pouring in on the Dallas Cowboys +3, the line has remained completely static at Detroit -3.0 since opening. This is a classic example of reverse line movement, where oddsmakers refuse to budge despite heavy public sentiment, indicating that sharp money is quietly taking the Lions.\n\nDallas is in a dangerous spot here, coming off an emotionally charged victory against the Chiefs. This sets them up for a classic letdown performance on the road against a Lions team that historically performs exceptionally well after a loss, boasting a 3-1 ATS record in such situations. Expect a motivated Detroit squad to expose this public trap and control the game at home.",

This protocol application yields a significantly lower projected total, creating a strong edge on the UNDER, while Texas Tech's superior PPA statistically supports them, albeit against a substantial spread.",

    "timestamp": "2025-12-07T07:20:47.101893",
    "analysis": "The spread analysis is anchored by the absence of the Chaos Factor, as Miami (OH)'s Havoc Rate is below the 22% threshold. This, combined with Western Michigan's slightly superior defensive PPA, suggests they are the more stable side to cover a minimal spread. The Totals Anchor protocol mandates assuming a Championship Defense with a -9 point deflator for games without prior meetings, initially pointing to the Under. However, a Sharp Alert indicating juiced money on the Over directly contradicts this protocol instruction, necessitating a pass on the total.",

    "analysis": "The primary anchor for the total is the Championship Defense deflator, reducing the projected total to 39.5, which is further supported by the sharp alert on the Under. The edge for the spread comes from the absence of a strong spread anchor for the favorite and nearly identical PPA stats, suggesting a tight, low-scoring game where taking the underdog plus points is prudent.",

    "analysis": "The spread for Virginia is validated by comparing team statistics, specifically their superior PPA (0.189) against Duke's (0.252), and Duke's Havoc Rate (17.7%) does not meet the Chaos Factor threshold. Virginia's stronger defensive metrics provide a statistical edge to cover the modest -3.5 spread, with no protocol rule explicitly favoring the underdog here. The Totals Anchor instructs to assume Championship Defense with a -9 pts deflator when no prior meeting, which would lean Under the 57.5 total. However, the SHARP ALERT indicating juiced action on the Over directly contradicts this protocol-driven lean, making the total a mandatory pass due to contradictory data.",

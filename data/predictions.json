    "analysis": "Selection: Detroit Lions -3.0\nConfidence: 87%\nAnalysis: The Angle for this matchup heavily favors Detroit due to Dallas's precarious situational spot combined with a clear market undervaluation of the Lions. Coming off an emotional win against an elite opponent and now traveling on a short week, Dallas is in a prime letdown position. Our verified math anchor projects Detroit as a 5.5-point favorite, highlighting the significant value at the current DraftKings line of -3.0. Despite Dallas's higher recent scoring output (L3 PPG of 29.3 compared to Detroit's 22.3) and limited specific rushing data for both teams, we are confidently backing the Lions to exploit the Cowboys' vulnerable state and cover the spread at home.",

    "analysis": "Selection: Detroit Lions -3.0\nConfidence: 85%\nAnalysis: The Angle here is the significant discrepancy between our verified math model and the current market offering, compounded by a clear situational letdown for Dallas. Our projections indicate the Lions should be favored by 5.5 points, presenting strong value with the market at -3.0. Coming off an emotionally draining victory against an elite opponent, the Cowboys now face a road game on a short week, creating a prime fade opportunity. We are confidently backing Detroit to exploit this undervalued line and cover at home.",

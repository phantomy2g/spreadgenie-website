FINAL PICK\n\nSelection Dallas Cowboys +3.0\nConfidence 72% (MEDIUM)\nLogic The V8.0 Model projects the Detroit Lions to win by 2.0 points, which is 1.0 point less than the Vegas spread of Lions -3.0. This difference indicates an edge towards the Dallas Cowboys +3.0. The projection for Dallas incorporates a -2.5 adjustment for playing on the road and a -1.5 adjustment for a short week. For Detroit, a +3.0 home-field advantage (dome) is applied, but this is partially offset by a -1.5 for the short week and a -2.0 adjustment for facing a Top 10 defense (Dallas). No sharp override triggers were met, and the Trap Score was 0.",

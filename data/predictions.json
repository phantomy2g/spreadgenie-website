    "analysis": "The market is flashing a nuclear trap signal on this matchup. With an overwhelming 88% of the public money pouring in on the Dallas Cowboys +3, the line has remained completely static at Detroit -3.0 since opening. This is a classic example of reverse line movement, where oddsmakers refuse to budge despite heavy public sentiment, indicating that sharp money is quietly taking the Lions.\n\nDallas is in a dangerous spot here, coming off an emotionally charged victory against the Chiefs. This sets them up for a classic letdown performance on the road against a Lions team that historically performs exceptionally well after a loss, boasting a 3-1 ATS record in such situations. Expect a motivated Detroit squad to expose this public trap and control the game at home.",

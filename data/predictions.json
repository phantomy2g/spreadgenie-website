THE ANGLE\n\nThe core angle is a Nuclear Trap Signal: the static betting line on Detroit -3.0 despite 88% of the money handle being on the Dallas Cowboys +3. This indicates Vegas is inviting public action on the Cowboys while holding the line, a classic setup for a fade.\n\n## 2. THE STORY\n\nThe Cowboys enter this prime-time matchup after an emotional victory against the Chiefs, driving heavy public confidence and betting action their way. However, the Lions, typically resilient after a loss, are favored by Vegas who refuse to budge on the spread, creating a dangerous trap for the heavily-bet Dallas side.\n\n## 3. DATA STATUS\n\n| Data Point | Status | Value |\n|------------|--------|-------|\n| Spread | [VERIFIED] | DET -3.0 |\n| Total | [VERIFIED] | O/U 55.0 (Proj) |\n| **Score Ceiling** | **[VERIFIED]** | **BASE_PPG=28.0** |\n| Sharp Money | [VERIFIED] | 88% Handle on Cowboys +3 |\n| Injuries | [VERIFIED] | DAL: Diggs (CB) - OUT, Guyton (LT) - DOUBTFUL; DET: St. Brown (WR) - Q, LaPorta (TE) - OUT |\n\n## 4. SITUATIONAL DOMINANCE\n\n**Dallas Cowboys Situational Records:** 5-1 ATS as an underdog this season.\n**Detroit Lions Situational Records:** 3-1 ATS after a loss.\n\n**SITUATIONAL OVERRIDE TRIGGERED?** YES\n**LETDOWN SPOT CHECK:** YES (Cowboys after emotional W vs KC)\n**Verdict:** The Cowboys are in an emotional letdown spot after a big win, which, when combined with heavy public backing, makes them vulnerable despite their strong ATS record as underdogs. The Lions' bounce-back history after a loss is a strong counter-narrative.\n\n## 5. SHARP MONEY ANALYSIS\n\n**Split:** 88% Handle on Cowboys +3\n**Signal:** Nuclear Trap\n**Analysis:** The line opened at Detroit -3.0 and has remained static at -3.0 despite an overwhelming 88% of the money handle backing the Cowboys +3. This lack of line movement against heavy public money is a textbook \"Nuclear Trap Signal,\" indicating professional bettors are on the opposite side, or Vegas is confident in the true line.\n\n## 6. TRAP SCORE\n\n**Calculated on:** Cowboys +3 (The side being faded)\n\u25a1 Public > 70% on Dog/Fav: +3 pts (88% on Cowboys)\n\u25a1 Line Doesn't Match Eye Test: +2 pts (Model DET by 8 vs Vegas DET by 3, public heavily on DAL)\n\u25a1 Situational Letdown? YES (+3 pts - Cowboys after big win vs KC)\n\u25a1 Prime-time Game? YES (+1 pt - Thursday Night)\n**Total Score: 9 pts** (Score > 5 mandates FADE)\n\n## 7. INJURY ASYMMETRY\n\n**Dallas Cowboys Status:** Trevon Diggs (CB) - OUT, Tyler Guyton (LT) - DOUBTFUL\n**Detroit Lions Status:** Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR) - QUESTIONABLE, Sam LaPorta (TE) - OUT\n**Who is MORE hurt?** Lions (as stated in verified data, specifically on offense)\n**Net Edge:** While the Lions' offense is slightly more hurt with LaPorta OUT and St. Brown Q, the Cowboys' defensive loss of Diggs (CB) and potential O-line hit with Guyton (LT) adds to their vulnerabilities. However, the verified data states Lions are \"slightly MORE HURT,\" so this is a net negative for Detroit, but not enough to offset the trap signal.\n\n## 8. PROJECTION SUMMARY\n\n**Model Line:** DET by 8.0 (Based on V8.4 Math)\n**Vegas Line:** DET by 3.0\n**Discrepancy:** 5.0 points\n\n## 9. DISQUALIFIER CHECK\n\n- Wind \u226520 mph: NO (DOME)\n- QB making 2nd career start: NO\n- Critical Offensive/Defensive Player Status is OUT: YES (LaPorta OUT for DET, Diggs OUT for DAL)\n- Sharp money opposes the pick: YES (Sharp money on Cowboys +3, pick is Lions -3)\n- Final Score Projection does not align with pick margin: NO (Model DET by 8, pick DET -3. Aligns.)\n**LOCK ELIGIBLE?** NO\n\n## 10. SIGNAL ALIGNMENT\n\n**Aligned:** 5/5\n1. Nuclear Trap Signal (mandates fade of Cowboys)\n2. Situational Letdown (Cowboys in emotional letdown spot)\n3. Sharp Money Analysis (Static line against public money)\n4. Trap Score > 5 (9 points, mandates fade of Cowboys)\n5. Projection Discrepancy (Model favors Lions by 5 more points than Vegas)\n\n## 11. THE PICK\n\n### **DETROIT LIONS -3.0**\n**Confidence:** STRONG\n\n## 12. THE CALL\n\nThis game presents a textbook \"Nuclear Trap Signal\" with a static line holding at Lions -3.0 despite 88% of the public money pouring in on the Cowboys. The calculated Trap Score of 9 strongly mandates fading the public, aligning perfectly with the Lions covering. While injuries and opposing sharp money prevent a LOCK, the overwhelming trap signal and strong situational factors make Detroit -3.0 a STRONG play.",
